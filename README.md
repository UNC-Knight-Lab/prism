# prism
Welcome to the PRISM (Polymers: Rate Insights and Sequence Modeling) package, offered by the Knight Lab at UNC Chapel Hill! This script was developed by Supraja Chittari (suprajac@email.unc.edu) and is compiled as a Python package.

## Installation Instructions
A version of Python >= 3.7 is required to use this package. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) to install Python for those new to Python.
1. Open the terminal (MacOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).
2. Download the package by either:
   1. Download the zip from GitHub (Code -> Download ZIP). Unzip the package somewhere (note the extraction path). The extracted package can be deleted after installation.
   2. Clone this repository (requires git to be installed) with:
      
   `git clone https://github.com/UNC-Knight-Lab/prism.git`

3. Install the package using pip. This command will install this package to your Python environment.
    The package path should be the current working directory `.` if cloned using git. Otherwise, replace it with the path to the `prism` folder.
      
   `pip install .`
   or `pip install /path/to/package/prism`

That's it!
